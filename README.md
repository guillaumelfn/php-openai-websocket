# php-openai-websocket
a php websocket server with GPT completion and it's html client to interface with it.

Thats fairly easy, clone the repo.
Change OpenAI to put in your OpenAI key and setup parameters for which model, temperature, etc to set in.
Change server.php and put in which host and port it has to listen to 
Change config.json to put in which host and port the client should connect to

run php server.php

and then go on http://localhost/ 

And you should connect to your little openAI mind. 

Enjoy !
